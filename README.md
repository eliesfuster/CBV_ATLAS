# CBV_ATLAS

This CBV atlas was generated using the CBV maps compiled by the multicenter and international retrospective clinical study NCT03439332. These maps were non-linearly co-registered with ANTS software (SyN algorithm) using cross correlation as a similarity metric. Finally, the atlas was calculated using the median CBV value at each voxel, excluding the areas affected by the tumor lesion for each patient.
